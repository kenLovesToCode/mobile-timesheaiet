## Epic Completion Verification

Epic 3 story statuses in sprint tracking:

- `3-1-add-to-shopping-list-with-quantity`: `done`
- `3-2-dedupe-by-barcode-and-adjust-quantity`: `done`
- `3-3-check-items-in-cart-and-view-list`: `done`

Result:

- Stories completed: 3/3
- Epic completion by story status: complete

## Participants

- ken (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)

## User-Provided Retrospective Inputs

- What went well: everything is great
- Biggest friction/challenge: none
- Previous retro follow-through concerns: none
- Epic 4 readiness approach: prep-first confirmed
- Epic 4 updates mandatory before implementation: yes
- Readiness check:
  - Testing & quality confidence: high
  - Deployment status: live
  - Stakeholder acceptance: accepted
  - Codebase stability: stable
  - Unresolved blockers: none
- Final reflection: none

## Successes and Strengths

- Epic 3 delivered full shopping-list baseline across all planned stories.
- Add-to-list flow matured from basic add to dedupe + quantity increment behavior.
- Concurrency and race-condition handling improved substantially in list interactions.
- Error rollback and user-facing feedback were hardened for write failures.
- Accessibility and semantics were strengthened for in-cart toggles.
- Shopping-list open performance evidence was captured and validated against AC2.

## Challenges and Growth Areas

- No major blockers were reported by the project lead.
- Main effort concentration was review hardening and proof quality, not feature uncertainty.
- Multiple review rounds focused on evidence rigor and measurement correctness, which improved process quality.

## Cross-Story Pattern Synthesis (Epic 3)

### Common Struggles

- Ensuring write operations remain deterministic under rapid repeated interactions.
- Keeping UX calm while still exposing clear recovery/error behavior.

### Recurring Review Feedback

- Prefer representative runtime evidence over synthetic-only test claims.
- Scope measurement metrics to true user-perceived events.
- Keep story artifacts synchronized with actual changed files.

### Breakthrough Moments

- Atomic increment and serialization strategy for shopping-list updates.
- Session-scoped performance evidence model for trustworthy AC2 validation.
- Stronger regression coverage around ordering, rollback, and duplicate-add flows.

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through (Epic 2 -> Epic 3)

Epic 2 retrospective emphasized evidence rigor and stabilization discipline.  
Epic 3 execution reflects this through:

- stronger claim-vs-evidence handling,
- explicit review follow-up closure,
- and concrete runtime performance capture.

No unresolved follow-through concerns were raised by the project lead.

## Next Epic Preview (Epic 4)

Epic 4: Navigation, Flow Guarding, and Home Experience

- Story 4.1: Primary Navigation Shell
- Story 4.2: Route Guarding for Results and Add Price
- Story 4.3: Home Screen UX Cleanup

Dependencies from Epic 3/Epic 2 outcomes:

- Keep Results access context-safe.
- Preserve non-blocking behavior while changing entry/navigation flows.
- Maintain current shopping-list stability while navigation shell changes are introduced.

## Significant Discovery Check

Conclusion: Epic update required before Epic 4 implementation.

Reason:

- Project lead explicitly confirmed prep-first execution and mandatory updates before implementation.

Required action:

- Run Epic 4 prep/update pass first, then begin implementation.

## Action Plan

### Process Improvements

1. Keep story-level claim-vs-evidence validation as a mandatory closure gate.
Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)  
Success criteria: each story closeout explicitly references evidence artifacts and validation commands.

2. Preserve review follow-up tracking blocks in story artifacts until all items are resolved.
Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)  
Success criteria: no unresolved review item remains when a story moves to done.

### Technical / Product Preparation for Epic 4

1. Finalize navigation-shell decisions and route map before coding starts.
Owner: Alice (Product Owner) + Charlie (Senior Dev)  
Success criteria: agreed route structure for Home, Stores, Scan, Shopping, and guarded Results/Add Price entry.

2. Define explicit guard behavior for missing barcode/store contexts.
Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)  
Success criteria: guard rules documented and traceable to Story 4.2 acceptance criteria.

3. Confirm Home experience content and CTA hierarchy.
Owner: Alice (Product Owner)  
Success criteria: Story 4.3 scope and acceptance details finalized for implementation handoff.

### Team Agreements

- Continue no-blame, system-focused retrospectives.
- Keep evidence quality high without sacrificing flow simplicity.
- Treat navigation and guard behavior as first-class product requirements.

## Preparation Tasks (Epic 4)

### Critical Path

1. Epic 4 prep/update review session completed and approved.
2. Navigation and route-guard decisions finalized.
3. Story 4.1-4.3 implementation notes aligned with updated decisions.

### Parallel Tasks

1. Add/refresh regression tests for Results guard behavior.
2. Add/refresh navigation smoke tests for tab shell transitions.

## Readiness Assessment (Epic 3 Closure)

- Testing & Quality: high confidence
- Deployment: live
- Stakeholder Acceptance: accepted
- Technical Health: stable
- Unresolved Blockers: none

Assessment:

- Epic 3 is fully complete and ready to hand off into Epic 4 preparation.

## Commitments and Next Steps

- Action items: 5
- Preparation tasks: 5
- Critical path items: 3
- Epic update required: yes (before Epic 4 implementation)

Immediate next steps:

1. Execute Epic 4 prep/update review.
2. Confirm guard/navigation/home decisions.
3. Start Epic 4 story implementation only after prep completion.

## Retrospective Outcome

- Epic 3 retrospective complete.
- Retrospective captured at:
  - `/Users/kenlovestocode/Desktop/Me/ai/pricetag/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-3-retro-2026-02-27.md`
- Team leaves Epic 3 with stable delivery outcomes and clear Epic 4 entry criteria.
